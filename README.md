# New-AR-Studio-for-Physiotherapy
This project aims to redesign and improve physiotherapy education tools by addressing the high cost and complexity of current solutions, such as the augmented studio (https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/hci/projects/physio-education). Instead of relying on expensive technologies and live participants for data display, we will explore more accessible approaches using mixed reality (MR) headsets and low-cost prototyping techniques. The project involves fieldwork to identify key challenges and design requirements, followed by the development of improved UX solutions that combine MR headsets, manikins, 3D printing, electronic prototyping, and sensor integration with XR platforms for enhanced learning experiences.
